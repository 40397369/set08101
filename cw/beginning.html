			<p id="text">After four days of traveling through the dense rainforest from the closest village 
			the eager explorer and his three travel guides arrived at the entrance of the temple.They 
			had told him on the way how scared they were to enter as it was deemed to be impossible to 
			get out after entering as no one has ever returned.<br/>
			Looking at the temple it didn't seem as interesting or fortified as he had anticipated, just a thick 
			stone wall with a stone door and a lever to the left of the door, almost inviting him to pull it. Without 
			hesitation he pulls the lever but nothing happens. <br/>To the right he can see that a tall old tree had crashed
			into the side of the wall exposing a  small hole in the wall hopefully big enough to squeeze through. One 
			thing was sure, having the smallest body frame in the group heâ€™d definitely be the only one able to fit in.
